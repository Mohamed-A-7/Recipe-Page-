# Simple Omelette Recipe Page

This project is a solution to a **Front End Mentor** challenge. The goal of this challenge was to create a **Recipe Page** that presents a recipe with all necessary details, including ingredients, preparation time, instructions, and nutrition information. The layout was designed to be responsive, adapting to various screen sizes.

## Overview

The page is structured into different sections:
1. **Recipe Image**: A visual representation of the dish.
2. **Recipe Introduction**: A brief description of the recipe.
3. **Preparation Time**: Details on how long it takes to prepare and cook the dish.
4. **Ingredients**: A list of items needed to prepare the dish, with optional fillings.
5. **Instructions**: Step-by-step cooking directions.
6. **Nutrition Information**: A summary of the nutritional values of the dish without additional fillings.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is flexible and adjusts for different screen sizes.
- **Custom Fonts**: Two custom fonts were used to enhance the visual appeal (`Young Serif` and `Outfit`).
- **Color Scheme**: The page uses soft tones for a clean and comfortable viewing experience, with complementary colors for text and headings.
- **Simple and Clear Layout**: Sections are spaced out and easy to read, ensuring a good user experience.

### Challenges

- **Typography**: Choosing and applying the right fonts to match the recipe theme.
- **Color Balance**: Ensuring the text stands out while maintaining an inviting and friendly color palette.

## How to Use
